# Soltes Digraphs

In this (sub)repository, we give files giving examples of digraphs with the property that W(D)-W(D\v)=0 for all v in V(D).

Hereby we give k-regular (out-degree= in-degree = k) examples of
vertex-transitive digraphs and oriented graphs, as well as a
2-regular non-VT (of order 960).

The abundancy of solutions implies that the analogue of Soltes' problem for digraphs is in essence settled.
(one can expect infinitely many solutions for every integer z to W(D)-W(D\v)=z)
